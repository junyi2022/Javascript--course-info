### D3

D3 is more of a charting framework than a library. Nevertheless, there are excellent resources for learning it, including:

* The FreeCodeCamp _Data Visualization with D3_ course: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/
* _Interactive Data Visualization for the Web_ by Scott Murray (available through [O'Reilly for Higher Ed](http://hdl.library.upenn.edu/1017/7026) at the UPenn library)
* The D3 Documentation: https://d3js.org/
